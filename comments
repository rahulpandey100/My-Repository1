Poor folder structure
Poor naming of project
It is not making sense that what does Parabank, repository, src are doing


TestData Properties

- data set is poor
- only checking for psoitive cases, what about negative cases
- properties file should not contain locators


Test

-HomePageTest,Login and Registration
    - setup should be a part of properties files
    - You are repeating this in all tests, not a good approach
    - poor variable naming
    - rather than using sysout, you should use logging 
    - setup and tear down should be part of base class

    - what does lp.login doing? how you are verifing that you are logged in?
    - verifyThatUserLoggedInSuccessfully() this function is having customer name and you are asserting it with text 'welcome' , not good.
    - same for all other tests
    - very poorly designed test cases
    - you have created base class but did not use it properly? bad practise
    
Overall

- Bad design
- Poor variable naming
- Poor folder structure
- Poor test cases
- Poor use of base class and properties file

Next steps:

- fix all variable namings 
- fix folder structure
- fix readme ( i have added comments there)
- add manual cases in a file
- fix all tests
- add pending work
